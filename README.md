# Simple and Cheap Setup for Measuring Timed Responses to Auditory Stimuli

This repository holds further instructions to assembly and use the proposed
setup in _"Simple and Cheap Setup for Measuring Timed Responses 
to Auditory Stimuli"_ (Miguel et al., under review). 

## The setup

The setup allows recording response times with respect to an auditory stimuli
by using a sound card with stereo input and output as an inexpensive
acquisition device. To sychronize the responses to the stimulus, one channel of
the output must be looped back into one of the input channels of the recording
device. The other channel of the recording is used to capture the signal from
the input device. For simplicty, we also consider the recording device to have
an extra output connection than can be used to connect speakers or headphones.
Inexpensive USB external sound cards provide these capabilities.
